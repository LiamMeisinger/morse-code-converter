Writing down some thoughts I have to be able to formulate a plan.

1. Need an input from the user
    - Should be able to recieve morse and text
2. Set some parameters to adhere to:
    - American Morse
    - No punctuation
3. Set up a dictionary to pull from to create the morse code symbols. ANd to convert morse to text
4. Push back the morse code.
5. Explore some further thoughts on how to use the morse code for future projects to actually make this code useful.
6. Add some ASCII art for fun
